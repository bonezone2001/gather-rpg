Tutorial for game in the INFO section!
"main.pde" is the entry point

INFO
--------------------
Small fast paced RPG(esk) game made by Kyle Pelham (20050825)
The goal of the game is to get through as many levels and get as much score as you
can before the 60 second level timer is out. Timer resets upon progression. To progress through
levels, you must defeat enemies that drop orbs. Once all the good orbs are collected, you progress
to a random next level

NOTE: You can enter Debug mode by setting the 'DEBUG' constant in the "Game"
class, OR through the main menu options. This will enable the level editor and 
show the path finding for... debugging.

ANOTHER NOTE: A lot of the code does not do encapsulation justice, this was an after though I
was going to iron out in refactoring (I usually do it while I'm programming the thing but this
time I forgot). Getters/Setters should have really been used, etc, etc. However, this is too large
for me to refactor in the given time now :O
